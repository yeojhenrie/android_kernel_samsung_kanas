Naive interface for cpu hotplugging modules
By ME<enriquezmark36@gmail.com>

Background and rationale:
-------------------------
I'd like to learn how to code in c.

----------
Interface:
----------
The implementation relies on struct hotplugger_driver which is defined by this

struct hotplugger_driver {
	char	name[DRIVER_NAME_LEN];
	int	(*change_state)	(bool state);
	bool	(*is_enabled)	(void);
	char	**whitelist;
	struct list_head	list;
};

where DRIVER_NAME_LEN is a char array with length of 32 bytes.

change_state is a function pointer which this interface uses to activate
or deactivate a module. Note that it doesn't unload the module instead
it only disables/enables it. Usually, change_state wraps to an
"enabled" variable plus some housekeeping if the module relies on
threads or workqueues. This may return a non-zero value on error.

is_enabled is a function pointer whose only task is to check whether the
module is running and doing its work. It returns either true or false.

From this point, I'd like to make myself clear about what "activation" means.
It just means starting the work the modules should be doing.

The whitelist is an array of c-strings or a char array, and would
be used to determine which modules would be disabled when a module is being
activated.

By default, the hotplugger_disable_conflicts() function would disable
all running modules. The whitelist would then prevent a running module
from being disabled.

The whitelist contains the set of modules' names as string literals which
will be not be disabled upon the module activation.
No racism intended nor regex parser implemented.

These lists should have NULL as its last element. This is a MUST.

Should the whitelist be initialized to NULL, all running modules will be
disabled upon that module's activation.

When the whitelist is initialized to a {NULL} the list WOULD STILL BE PARSED
but every running and registered module will be disabled just like the
default behavior.

Currently there's no easy way to whitelist a module to all other modules.
It may be needed to either not register this module to this interface
or add it to everyone's whitelists.

--------------------
Using the whitelist:
--------------------

TL;DR;
Never initialize the whitelist in a stack.
In order of the whitelist to work, the whitelisting should be mutual;
module1 should whitelist module2 and module2 should whitelist module1.

If by chance you've to initialize your list in an init function,
the list should NOT be allocated to stack like this.

.whitelist=(char*[]){"another_name", NULL},

Your list would be corrupted by the time the init function returns.
As much as possible, use a list (char*[])
with static storage life.

You could write up something like this:

static char *whitelist[] = {"another_name", NULL};

put it in your init function or outside the functions as a
global variable and set the whitelist to that:

.whitelist=whitelist,

Also, as a safety measure for the careless and newbies, like me, you
have to add the names of the modules in the whitelist for both of them.
Let's say you have module1 and module2. You want to whitelist both so
that module1 can run alongside module2. For module1 you can create your
whitelist like this.

static char *module1_WList[] = {"module2", NULL};

And simillarly for module 2:

static char *mod2_WList[] = {"module1", NULL};

---------------------
Creating an instance:
---------------------

TL;DR;
Include the header, define a struct hotplugger_driver, register the
result of previous step in an init function, unregister at the exit
function.

Remember to include the header hotplugger.h
#include <linux/hotplugger.h>

Here's an example using a whitelist, where "handler" is the name

static struct hotplugger_driver handler = {
	.name = "module_name",
	.change_state = &toggle,
	.is_enabled = &enabled,
	.whitelist = (char*[]){"another_name", "other_name", NULL},
};

Note: You could choose to do the initialization of the struct
      in the module_init function and keep a global variable
      to prevent issues about implicit declarations and such.
      something like this:
.......somewhere at the top......
static struct hotplugger_driver handler;
...
... some codes and functions
...
...some_module_init(...)
{
...
	handler = (struct hotplugger_driver) {
		.name = "module_name",
		.change_state = &toggle,
		.is_enabled = &enabled,
	};
...

Note: Or, just "split" function declaration and intialization.
      Notice the two "static struct hotplugger_driver handler".
      It should work considering how cpufreq_governor.c is written.
      To be honest, I like this one better as it wont initialize
      "handler" everytime the init function is called.
.......somewhere at the top......
static struct hotplugger_driver handler;
...
... some codes and functions
...
...
static struct hotplugger_driver handler = {
	.name = "module_name",
	.change_state = &toggle,
	.is_enabled = &enabled,
	.whitelist = (char*[]){"another_name", "other_name", NULL},
};
...

After you've created it, register it using hotplugger_register_driver()
like so:

hotplugger_register_driver(&handler);

If your module is unloadable, then make sure to unregister it with
hotplugger_unregister_driver().

hotplugger_register_driver(&handler);

Next is to disable other running modules.

Tip: There exists a macro is_enabled_func(variable) which will
     create a wrapper function around variable. The macro creates
     a is_enabled() function of type bool something like these.

     static bool is_enabled (void)

     If the variable corresponds to a disabled variable instead
     of enabled there exists is_not_enabled_func(variable) macro
     which is essentially the same with is_enabled_func macro
     but with its return values switched.

     NOTE that this does NOT check whether the variable or struct
     containing the variable is valid. You are going to have a bad
     time debugging when let's say you have a struct mystruct
     containing the "enabled" variable. But, you didn't made it static
     and have to use kmalloc(). When struct mystruct is NULL and
     you've called any of the functions here, even simply
     reading/writing the sysfs files, in my case, the kernel would
     panic and lock-up but there would be no logs, backtrace
     stacktrace, dumps and etc... would be shown. That's all.

---------------------------------------------
Disable/enable running modules from the code:
---------------------------------------------

Every time your module is resuming/starting it's work
you have to call hotplugger_disable_conflicts() function
defined by this

int hotplugger_disable_conflicts(struct hotplugger_driver *driver);

The first argument is to provides the list and the identification of
the module. This is the function that tries to parse and disable
running modules according to the list.

This would return 0 in success any other value is an error.

But if for some reason you want to enable a cpu hotplug module
you could use hotplugger_enable_one() defined as

int hotplugger_enable_one(char *name);

Unlike the previous function, you can use this anywhere.
It takes the name of the module you want to activate/enable as
its first parameter. It also returns a non-zero integer when there's
an error. Plus, it doesn't use a whitelist although the module you
would activate may probably call hotplugger_disable_conflicts()
which would probably disable the calling module.

It might be better to enclose all these codes in an #ifdef macro
so that you could compile the module even without the
CONFIG_HOTPLUGGER_INTERFACE being set.
You could probably do it like this:

#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUGGER_INTERFACE
...code here...
#endif

or use the IS_ENABLED macro make it look like a C code

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_HOTPLUGGER_INTERFACE)) {
...code here...
}

------------
Sysfs files:
------------

The sysfs knobs can be found at /sys/kernel/hotplugger.
and contains three files.

    available_drivers [read-only, 0444]
    enable_driver     [read-write, 0644]
    disable_driver    [read-write, 0644]
    enabled           [read-write, 0644]

available_drivers shows all of the modules registered, everything
enclosed in square brackets [] are currently running. You cannot
write to this file.

enable_driver shows all of running modules. Writing the name
of the module here would be enabled. This could return a non-zero
value in error.

disable_driver shows all of stopped modules. Like the enable_driver,
writing the name of the running module would be disabled.

By the current implementation, you may not enable or disable multiple
modules in one invocation.

enabled shows whether the interface is enabled. You can only write
0 or 1 as integers, not string or "1" or "0" -- quotation marks included.
0 represents off while 1 represents on. Writing 0 to this file
will disable most of the features of this interface. Writing 1 will
undo it.

By default, the interface is enabled.

-------------------------
Enable/Disable Interface:
-------------------------
Defined in hotplug.c, the interface state is reflected in a variable
named "enabled" with type "atomic_t".

Obviously, there are two states: on(1) and off(0).

Sysfs file "enabled", which may be located at /sys/kernel/hotplugger/,
can be used to "switch off/on" the interface's functions.

When the state is on(1), obviously, all functions are active.
When the sate is off(0), You can STILL un/register modules or drivers
but you may not use these functions:
    int hotplugger_disable_conflicts(struct hotplugger_driver *driver);
    int hotplugger_enable_one(const char *name);

As of now, there's no way to toggle the state in the code unless by
hacking.

---------------------------------------
Lock ups and hangs and troubleshooting:
---------------------------------------
Read up how to enable debugging in the kernel and
add this in your .config file:
CONFIG_HOTPLUGGER_INTERFACE_DEBUG=y

About 80% of the time, the problem lies within your modules code
and how the functions, passed through the function pointers, behave.

So first, try to not use the is_enabled_func macro and create your own
function of the is_enabled() function pointer.

Check whether your struct hotplugger_driver variable is valid, not NULL,
or even allocated in the stack, and initialized before you use
the functions to disable/enable other modules.

Make sure the you register your struct hotplugger_driver variable
ONCE and remove it once you're really sure it won't be used again.
Like when the module is unloaded or the cpufreq governor is not being
used in any of the processors.

Mind the return values of the hotplugger_disable_conflicts() and
hotplugger_enable_one() functions, they are put there for a reason.

The other 17% is from this module, so feel free to modify this
under GPL.

The 2% is from quirks the linux kernel. Try to NOT build this
interface and try to manually switch modules.
The 1% is from your luck and fate. There isn't much to do.
